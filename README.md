# HackWasm
This is a mono-repo for everything related to HackWasm Berlin 2023 sponsored by Aura Network

From July 14th until 16th, HackWasm Berlin is scheduled to run at Spielfeld Digital Hub, Berlin, Germany. This is the 1st CosmWasm-focused hackathon organized by Confio and sponsored by 4 global crypto projects who are also big supporters of CosmWasm; Aura network, Finschia, Neutron, and OKP4 !

## Who are we
Aura Network is an ecosystem built to accelerate global NFTs adoption. Aura Network focuses on building the Internet of NFTs and bringing NFT and web3 culture to the Asian market. Aura Network Foundation works directly with brands, IP owners, game publishers to bring their web2 portfolios to web3. Aura is built using Cosmos SDK and CosmWasm and is committed to support open source, public goods for the Cosmos ecosystem. Aura Network is backed by both top-tier web3 and traditional venture capitals such as: Hashed, Coin98, FPT GuildFi, Republic Crypto, Matchbox DAO,  Kyber, GBV, NGC, SNZ, etc.

## What we are looking for
*Note: We will add more details gradually in May and June so you will have better chance to find suitable topics and practice before the hack.*

Due to the time limit of the hackathon (3 days), we do not expect the participant can deliver a full featured product. Thus, a solid pitch accompanied with a demo of core components such as protocol primitives, proof of concept or MVPs are acceptable.

Regarding the sponsor track by Aura Network, here are several topics that we are highly interested in:

- **Crosschain Gambling Game**: Leveraging Aura pre-built infrastructure of ibc-proxy and onchain randomness to build primitives for gambling games on multiple chains at the same time.
- **NFT-related protocols**: Any protocols that help increasing utilities of CW-721, CW-1155 or CW-4973 (Account Bound Token).
- **Mobile Game**: Leveraging [Aura Mobile SDK](https://github.com/aura-nw/aura-mobile-sdk) (Flutter & Unity) to integrate web3 into your mobile game or make new primitives for mobile developers.
- **User Onboarding Solution**: solution involving better ways for user onboarding such as account abstraction, feegranting, authz, etc. that can be programmed directly on CosmWasm.

Beside these topics, if you have any other idea that fit into the theme of Aura: User onboarding, NFT focus, Gaming, etc that can be deployed on Aura Network, please feel free to apply.
